     IActor defines the common functionality of all actors. An actor
     offers a collection of management operations for slices and reservations and
     implements the public methods necessary to serve calls from other actors,
     e.g., requests for tickets and leases.

     Every actor has a globally unique identifier and a name. The current
     implementation assumes that names are globally unique. In addition, each
     actor can have an optional description (used for display purposes, e.g., the
     web portal).

     The actions of each actor, e.g, how to request new resources, how to
     arbitrate among multiple ticket requests, etc, are driven by policy modules.

     There are three types of actors:
         Orchestrator -
         Broker - arbiter among requests for resources. Brokers determine who gets what and for how long.
         Aggregate Manager - owner of resources.

         Each of the aforementioned roles is defined in a corresponding interface. An
         actor instance must implement at least one of these interfaces.
